  If you require additional support, please stop in to the Write Place located in the Knowledge Hub, Roesch Library first floor. If you are not a residential student and require additional writing support, please contact the Write Place Coordinator at <a href="mailto:cklimo1@udayton.edu">cklimo1@udayton.edu</a>.<br /><br /> \
  Attention Graduate Writers: If you have a longer writing assignment to be reviewed by a writing consultant, a thesis or dissertation document, please contact the Write Place at <a href="mailto:writeplace@udayton.edu">writeplace@udayton.edu</a>.

Comments and suggested corrections will be provided by using the revision tool in MS Word. A response to your paper can be expected within 48 hours. Any information you can offer regarding the writing assignment or your areas of concern will be beneficial to the consultant.<br /><br /> \
  Please submit each paper only once. You may upload one writing assignment at a time.<br /><br /> \
